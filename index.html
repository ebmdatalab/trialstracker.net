      <p>The results of clinical trials are used by doctors, researchers and patients to make informed choices about treatments.</p>

      <p>Sadly, the results of clinical trials are commonly left unreported, despite several decades of guidelines, position statements, policies and even legislation. There is an active global campaign around this issue at <a href="https://www.alltrials.net/">AllTrials.net</a>.</p>

      <p>The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science is a mixed multidisciplinary team of clinicians, academics, and software engineers, pooling skills to produce high-impact informatics tools as well as pure academic research papers. You can read more about our work at <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/">bennett.ox.ac.uk</a></p>

      <p>We have produced a range of audits and trackers all monitoring the trial reporting performance and policies of pharmaceutical companies, universities, funders, sponsors, and other organisations.</p>

      <p>This is a holding page. Resource permitting, we will soon bring together all metrics on trials transparency from our own work, and other teams, in one friendly front-end of dashboards and indicators.</p>

      <p>Before then, here is a list of our outputs to date:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://fdaaa.trialstracker.net/">FDAAA.TrialsTracker.net</a></dt>
        <dd>A live website tool that monitors, on a daily basis, every trial on clinicaltrials.gov that breaches the FDA Amendments Act 2007</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://eu.trialstracker.net/">EU.TrialsTracker.net</a></dt>
        <dd>A live website tool that monitors, on a monthly basis, every trial that breaches EU rules on trial reporting, with transparency performance rankings for every individual company and university.</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://policyaudit.alltrials.net/">PolicyAudit.AllTrials.net</a></dt>
        <dd>A dynamic, interactive explorer for all pharmaceutical companiesâ€™ trials transparency policies.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://trialstracker.ebmdatalab.net/">TrialsTracker.EBMDataLab.net</a></dt>
        <dd>Our original prototype TrialsTracker, with rankings for major trial sponsors, and automatic searching of PubMed.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.compare-trials.org/">COMPare-Trials.org</a></dt>
        <dd>A project correcting misreported trials in major journals as soon as they are published.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>All of these projects have associated journal publications.</p>

      <p>We also have a large number of additional outputs including commentary, research papers, static audits, and policy reports.</p>

      <p>Please check back soon for more. If you are interested in our work, you can contact us easily: <a href="mailto:bennett@phc.ox.ac.uk">bennett@phc.ox.ac.uk</a></p>
